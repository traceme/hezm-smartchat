# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement File Upload API with Chunking and WebSocket
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the backend API endpoint for handling file uploads. Use FastAPI to create an endpoint that supports chunked uploads, SHA-256 checksum verification, and S3 pre-signed URLs for secure uploads. Implement WebSocket for real-time progress updates.
# Details:
1. Implement FastAPI endpoint for file uploads.
2. Implement chunked upload logic with 5MB chunks.
3. Implement SHA-256 checksum verification to prevent duplicate uploads.
4. Integrate S3 pre-signed URLs for secure uploads.
5. Implement WebSocket for real-time progress updates.

# Test Strategy:
Upload large files in chunks and verify that they are correctly assembled on the server. Verify that SHA-256 checksum verification prevents duplicate uploads. Verify that WebSocket updates are sent correctly during the upload process.
