## 2. Implement Caching for Document Metadata [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement caching for document metadata retrieved from the database. Use document IDs as cache keys. Configure appropriate cache expiration policies based on the frequency of metadata updates.
### Details:
Modify the document retrieval logic to first check the Redis cache for the document metadata. If found, return the cached data. If not found, retrieve the metadata from the database, store it in the Redis cache, and then return it. Implement a cache invalidation mechanism when document metadata is updated.
<info added on 2025-06-10T15:48:49.906Z>
**Major Accomplishments:**

1. **Created Document Cache Service** (`backend/services/document_cache.py`):
   - Comprehensive caching for document metadata retrieval
   - Document list caching with support for all query parameters (search, filters, sorting, pagination)
   - Cache key generation with deterministic hashing for consistent cache hits
   - Document serialization/deserialization with proper datetime handling
   - Cache invalidation strategies for individual documents and user lists

2. **Integrated Caching in Documents API** (`backend/routers/documents.py`):
   - **GET /api/documents/{id}**: Now uses Redis cache for individual document metadata (1-hour TTL)
   - **GET /api/documents/**: Now uses Redis cache for document lists (15-minute TTL)
   - Cache invalidation on document updates, deletes, and bulk operations
   - Graceful fallback to database when Redis unavailable

3. **Cache Invalidation Integration**:
   - Document updates trigger cache invalidation for specific document + user lists
   - Document deletes (soft/hard) trigger cache invalidation
   - Bulk deletes invalidate cache for all affected documents
   - File uploads invalidate user list cache when new documents are added

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Smart Cache Keys**: MD5 hash of query parameters ensures proper cache hits for complex queries
- **TTL Strategy**: 1-hour for document metadata, 15-minutes for dynamic lists
- **Cache-Through Pattern**: Always tries cache first, falls back to database, then updates cache
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Cache is automatically invalidated when data changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

**Performance Benefits:**
- Document metadata requests avoid database queries on cache hits
- Complex document list queries with filters cached effectively
- Reduced database load for frequently accessed documents
- Improved response times for repeat requests

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `backend/services/document_cache.py` (NEW) - Complete document caching service
- ✅ `backend/routers/documents.py` (UPDATED) - Integrated caching in all document endpoints
- ✅ `backend/routers/upload.py` (UPDATED) - Cache invalidation on new uploads

**Implementation Status**: Subtask 12.2 is fully complete. Document metadata caching is now operational with proper cache invalidation patterns. Ready to proceed to search results caching.

## 3. Implement Caching for Search Results [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement caching for search results obtained from the Qdrant vector database. Use the search query as the cache key. Configure cache expiration policies based on the frequency of data updates and the volatility of search results.
### Details:
Modify the search functionality to first check the Redis cache for the search results. If found, return the cached results. If not found, perform the search query against the Qdrant database, store the results in the Redis cache, and then return them. Consider using a more complex cache key if the search query parameters are extensive.
<info added on 2025-06-10T15:53:23.389Z>
**Major Accomplishments:**

1. **Created Search Cache Service** (`backend/services/search_cache.py`):
   - Comprehensive caching for semantic search results with query normalization
   - Hybrid search results caching with support for fusion parameters
   - Document chunks caching for pagination support
   - Smart cache key generation with query parameter hashing
   - Proper serialization/deserialization of search results and datetime objects

2. **Integrated Caching in Search API** (`backend/routers/search.py`):
   - **POST /search/semantic**: Now uses Redis cache for vector search results (15-minute TTL)
   - **GET /search/documents/{id}/chunks**: Now uses Redis cache for document chunks (30-minute TTL)
   - Cache hit/miss indicators in response metadata
   - Graceful fallback to original search when cache unavailable

3. **Comprehensive Cache Invalidation**:
   - Document deletion triggers search cache invalidation for affected documents
   - Bulk document deletion invalidates search cache for all affected documents
   - New document uploads invalidate user search cache (collection changed)
   - Search cache invalidation integrated with document lifecycle

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Query Normalization**: Queries are normalized (trimmed, lowercased) for consistent cache hits
- **Parameter Awareness**: Cache keys include all search parameters (limits, thresholds, weights)
- **Scope-based Caching**: Separate cache scopes for user-wide vs document-specific searches
- **TTL Strategy**: 15-min for search results, 30-min for more stable document chunks
- **Cache Statistics**: Built-in monitoring capabilities for cache performance analysis

**Performance Benefits:**
- Semantic search requests avoid expensive vector embedding computation on cache hits
- Document chunk requests bypass Qdrant queries for repeated page browsing
- Reduced load on vector database and embedding service
- Improved response times for repeated search queries

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `backend/services/search_cache.py` (NEW) - Complete search results caching service
- ✅ `backend/routers/search.py` (UPDATED) - Integrated caching in semantic search and chunks endpoints
- ✅ `backend/routers/documents.py` (UPDATED) - Search cache invalidation on document operations
- ✅ `backend/routers/upload.py` (UPDATED) - Search cache invalidation on new uploads

**Implementation Status**: Subtask 12.3 is fully complete. Search results caching is now operational with proper cache invalidation patterns. Ready to proceed to conversation history caching.
