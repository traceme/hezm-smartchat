## 4. Implement Monitoring Stack [done]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Set up a monitoring stack using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager to collect metrics, visualize data, and configure alerts.
### Details:
Install and configure Prometheus to collect metrics from the application and infrastructure. Set up Grafana to visualize the metrics. Configure Alertmanager to send alerts based on predefined thresholds.

## 5. Implement Health Checks [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement health check endpoints for both frontend and backend applications to monitor their status.
### Details:
Create health check endpoints for the frontend and backend applications that return a 200 OK status if the application is healthy. Configure the load balancer to use these health checks to route traffic to healthy instances.
<info added on 2025-06-11T01:56:53.620Z>
âœ… **Comprehensive Health Checks Implemented**

**Backend Enhancements:**
- **Dedicated Health Router:** Created a new router at `backend/routers/health.py` with multiple, detailed endpoints:
  - `/health/basic`: Simple 200 OK for basic load balancer checks.
  - `/health/liveness`: Kubernetes liveness probe to ensure the app is running.
  - `/health/readiness`: Kubernetes readiness probe, checking database, Redis, and dialogue service connectivity.
  - `/health/detailed`: A comprehensive diagnostic endpoint with status of all components, system metrics (CPU, memory, disk), and dependency health.
  - `/health/startup`: Verifies critical services are ready on application start.
  - `/health/dependencies`: Checks all external dependencies like Redis, vector DB, and embedding/LLM APIs.
- **Main App Integration:** Integrated the new health router into `backend/main.py`.
- **Dependency Ready:** Verified that `psutil` for system metrics is already in `pyproject.toml`.

**Frontend Enhancements:**
- **Health Check UI:** Created a sophisticated React component at `frontend/src/components/HealthCheck.tsx` for visualizing system health. It features:
  - Overall status display.
  - Detailed accordions for system metrics, service components, and external dependencies.
  - Auto-refresh and manual refresh functionality.
  - Quick buttons to test different health endpoints.
- **Nginx Health Probes:** Enhanced `frontend/nginx.conf` to include:
  - Probes for liveness and readiness (`/health/liveness`, `/health/readiness`).
  - A detailed health check that queries the backend's readiness state (`/health/detailed`).
  - Graceful error handling for unavailable backend services during health checks.

**Load Balancer Configurations:**
- **HAProxy:** Created a production-grade `infrastructure/load-balancer/haproxy.cfg` with:
  - Separate backends for frontend and API servers.
  - Advanced health checking (`option httpchk`) for both pools.
  - SSL termination and modern security headers.
  - A statistics page for monitoring.
- **Nginx:** Created an alternative `infrastructure/load-balancer/nginx.conf` with:
  - Upstream pools for frontend and backend.
  - Active health checks (`health_check`) using Nginx Plus features.
  - SSL termination and robust security headers.

This completes the implementation of a robust, production-ready health monitoring system.

### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3, 15.4, 15.6
### Description: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
### Details:

<info added on 2025-06-11T02:11:22.246Z>
âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline Implemented with GitHub Actions**

A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline has been established using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment lifecycle of the SmartChat application.

**Key Features:**

-   **Workflow Configuration (`.github/workflows/cicd.yml`):**
    -   **Three-Stage Pipeline:**
        1.  **Lint & Test:** Validates code quality and runs tests for both frontend and backend on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop`.
        2.  **Build & Push:** Builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub for pushes to `main` (`latest` tag) and `develop` (`develop` tag).
        3.  **Deploy:** Deploys the `latest` images to the production server on pushes to `main`.
    -   **Branch-based Logic:** Different actions are triggered based on the target branch (`main` vs. `develop`).
    -   **Environment Protection:** Uses GitHub Environments to protect the production deployment, allowing for rules like required reviewers.

-   **Documentation (`.github/workflows/README.md`):**
    -   **Clear Instructions:** Provides a detailed explanation of the pipeline's structure and jobs.
    -   **Setup Guide:** Lists the required GitHub secrets (`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, `PROD_SERVER_HOST`, etc.) needed to run the pipeline.
    -   **Workflow Triggers:** Explains when and why the pipeline runs.

This automated pipeline ensures that all code is tested and linted before integration, and that deployments are handled consistently and reliably.
