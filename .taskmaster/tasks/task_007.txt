# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Dialogue Engine with LLM Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core dialogue engine using vector search to retrieve the top-30 relevant fragments, then use bge-reranker-base to re-rank the fragments. Integrate multiple LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) to generate answers. Implement answer citation and streaming response generation.
# Details:
1. Implement vector search to retrieve top-30 relevant fragments.
2. Use bge-reranker-base to re-rank the fragments.
3. Integrate multiple LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini).
4. Implement answer citation and streaming response generation.
