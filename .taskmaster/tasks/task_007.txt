# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Dialogue Engine with LLM Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core dialogue engine using vector search to retrieve the top-30 relevant fragments, then use bge-reranker-base to re-rank the fragments. Integrate multiple LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) to generate answers. Implement answer citation and streaming response generation.
# Details:
1. Implement vector search to retrieve top-30 relevant fragments.
2. Use bge-reranker-base to re-rank the fragments.
3. Integrate multiple LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini).
4. Implement answer citation and streaming response generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test the dialogue engine with various queries and verify that it generates accurate and relevant answers. Verify that the answer citation and streaming response generation are working correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Vector Search Integration and Fragment Retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the vector search functionality with the existing services to retrieve the top-30 relevant fragments based on the user query. This includes setting up the connection to the vector database and implementing the query logic.
### Details:
Configure vector database connection, implement query logic, retrieve top-30 fragments.

## Implementation Details:

1. **DialogueService Core Class**: Created `backend/services/dialogue_service.py` with:
   - Vector search integration using existing VectorService
   - Fragment retrieval with configurable limits (top_k_initial=30, top_k_final=10)
   - Similarity threshold filtering (0.3)
   - Context generation with citation tracking
   - Prompt preparation for LLM integration

2. **LLM Service Integration**: Created `backend/services/llm_service.py` with:
   - Multi-provider support (OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash)
   - Streaming response support
   - Fallback mechanism between providers
   - Proper error handling and timeouts

3. **FastAPI Endpoints**: Created `backend/routers/dialogue.py` with:
   - `/api/dialogue/query` - Standard query processing
   - `/api/dialogue/query/stream` - Streaming responses
   - `/api/dialogue/models` - Available models status
   - `/api/dialogue/health` - Service health check
   - `/api/dialogue/stats` - Service statistics

4. **Pydantic Schemas**: Created `backend/schemas/dialogue.py` with:
   - QueryRequest/Response models
   - StreamQueryRequest for streaming
   - Citation model for source tracking
   - ConversationMessage for history

5. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test script `backend/test_dialogue_engine.py` for:
   - Vector search functionality
   - Context generation 
   - Prompt preparation
   - LLM provider availability
   - Full query processing
   - Streaming functionality
   - Performance benchmarking

6. **Main App Integration**: Updated `backend/main.py` to include dialogue router

## Key Features Achieved:
- ✅ Vector search integration working
- ✅ Multi-LLM support with fallback
- ✅ Citation system implemented
- ✅ Streaming responses
- ✅ FastAPI endpoints ready
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints

The vector search integration is fully functional and ready for production use. All LLM providers can be configured via API keys, with automatic fallback if primary provider fails.

## 2. Implement BGE Re-ranking of Retrieved Fragments [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement the bge-reranker-base model to re-rank the fragments retrieved from the vector search. This involves loading the model and applying it to the retrieved fragments to improve the relevance of the results.
### Details:
Load bge-reranker-base model, implement re-ranking logic, integrate with vector search results.

## 3. Integrate Multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) for Answer Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Integrate the OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini LLMs to generate answers based on the re-ranked fragments. Implement a mechanism to select the appropriate LLM based on configuration or user preference.
### Details:
Implement API calls to OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini. Implement LLM selection logic.

## 4. Implement Answer Citation and Streaming Response Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement a system for citing the source fragments used to generate the answer. Implement streaming response generation to provide a more interactive user experience.
### Details:
Implement citation logic, implement streaming response using server-sent events or websockets.

## 5. Create FastAPI Endpoints for Dialogue API [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create FastAPI endpoints for the dialogue API to allow users to interact with the dialogue engine. This includes defining the API endpoints, request/response models, and integrating with the core dialogue engine logic.
### Details:
Define API endpoints, implement request/response models, integrate with dialogue engine.
