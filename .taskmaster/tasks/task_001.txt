# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project and Configure Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with FastAPI, React, and TypeScript. Configure basic project structure, including folders for backend, frontend, and common utilities. Set up initial configurations for linting, formatting, and version control. Project structure includes comprehensive backend, frontend, infrastructure, and documentation setup.
# Details:
1. Created a new repository.
2. Initialized backend with FastAPI, including main.py, config.py, and structured directories (models/, routers/, services/).
3. Initialized frontend with React and TypeScript using Material-UI v6.
4. Configured ESLint, Prettier, and Git.
5. Set up Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qdrant services.
6. Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions, project structure documentation, development workflow guidelines, and environment variable documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project structure is correctly set up and that the initial configurations for linting, formatting, and version control are working as expected. Confirm that the Docker and Docker Compose configurations are functional and that all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant) are running correctly. Ensure the frontend and backend applications are accessible and communicating as expected. Verify documentation accuracy.
